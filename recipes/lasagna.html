        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish consisting of alternating
            layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, savory fillings, and cheese,
            typically baked in an oven. Here's a brief description:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Pasta layers: Made from durum wheat, these broad, flat noodles
                form the structure of the dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauce: Usually a rich tomato-based sauce, often containing
                ground meat (beef or pork), though vegetarian versions exist.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cheese: Primarily uses mozzarella for its melting properties,
                and often includes ricotta and Parmesan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Filling variations: Can include vegetables, different meats, or
                seafood depending on the recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Texture: When cooked, it has a slightly crisp top layer, with
                soft, gooey inner layers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flavor profile: Savory, with a balance of tangy tomato, creamy
                cheese, and herbs like basil and oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                Appearance: When sliced, it reveals distinct layers, making for
                an visually appealing dish.
            </li>
        </ol>
