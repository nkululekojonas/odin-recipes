        <h3>Desciption</h3>
        <p>
            Carbonara is a Roman pasta dish known for its creamy sauce and
            simple ingredients. It typically uses spaghetti or another long
            pasta, coated in a silky sauce made from raw eggs, hard cheese
            (usually Pecorino Romano or Parmesan), and black pepper. The sauce
            is enriched with small pieces of guanciale (cured pork cheek) or
            pancetta, which are crisped before being mixed with the pasta. The
            hot pasta is tossed with the egg and cheese mixture off the heat,
            creating a smooth, glossy coating without scrambling the eggs.
