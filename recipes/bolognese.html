        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Bolognese, originating from Bologna, Italy, is a meat-based sauce
            traditionally served with tagliatelle pasta. This rich, slow-cooked
            sauce combines ground beef, pancetta, and a soffritto of finely
            chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Tomato paste, red wine, and
            milk or cream are added to create depth of flavor, while beef broth
            helps achieve the right consistency. The sauce is simmered for
            several hours, resulting in a thick, savory coating that clings well
            to pasta. While authentically served with tagliatelle, it's often
            paired with spaghetti in many parts of the world outside Italy.
